When next laptop, setup in this order:
iterm2 + zsh/ohmyzsh + tmux for the terminal
Microsoft VSCode (or JetBrains IntellijIDEA) as IDE for all languages.
    with a good vim keys binding
    with a one liner to launch it from the cli (on opening a file)
neovim with simple config as text editor. (+ sublime for interp files or huge test files)
